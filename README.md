# Hang

Hang is a Rust-based watch-party project for Windows. The Axum server runs on Render (https://letshang.onrender.com) and exposes a lightweight WebSocket API for room management, while the egui + libVLC desktop client keeps everyone's local video files perfectly in sync so friends can watch together.
